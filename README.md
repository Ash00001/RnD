# RnD
This is A Research and Developement Project based on tolology control in Wireless Sensor Netwoks.
# Contents
This reporsitory contains all the literature that we gone through in our research process and contains code files (Matlab) that were the two algorithms developed as a result of the RnD. The IGTC (Inscribed Grid Topology Control) and CGTC (Circumscribed Grid Based topology Control). These are the toplogy control algorithms and methods devised for a efficient and fault tolerant network of sensors and Supernodes responsible for on-site data collection and transmission to the sink or gateway.
